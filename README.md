# Basic Calculator in Assembly for 8086 Microprocessor
This assembly code implements a simple calculator program for the 8086 microprocessor. It prompts the user to input two single-digit numbers and select an arithmetic operation: addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Based on the user's choice, the program performs the corresponding calculation and displays the result. The code uses DOS interrupts for input and output operations, handling user inputs as ASCII characters and converting them for arithmetic operations. It includes error handling to manage division by zero. This program demonstrates fundamental concepts of assembly language programming, including data manipulation, conditional jumps, and interrupt handling.

# Usage
Compile the assembly code using an 8086 assembler.
Run the compiled program.
Follow the prompts to enter the first and second numbers (0-9).
# Choose an arithmetic operation:
1: Addition
2: Subtraction
3: Multiplication
4: Division
The program will display the result of the chosen operation.
